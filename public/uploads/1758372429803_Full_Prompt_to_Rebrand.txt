I need to fully rebrand this AI chat assistant website into a new AI assistant identity (name and branding) — a modern, professional assistant powered by Gemini AI (Gemini 1.5 / Gemini Pro).  

⚠️ Important:
- The name "NovaAI" is only a placeholder/reference.
- Always generate a new, unique brand name for each run (e.g., Lumena, AstraMind, VioraAI, etc.)
- Clearly mention in the description that the assistant is powered by Google’s Gemini models, but keep the frontend branding as the newly generated name.

✅ Instructions:
1. Branding & Identity:
   - Replace old brand name with a newly generated brand name.
   - Generate a matching futuristic tagline and short description.
   - Use a logo concept based on stars, sparks, AI energy, or cosmic intelligence.
   - Apply a fresh blue/indigo gradient color scheme.
   - Generate a unique favicon concept.
   - Update all meta tags dynamically.

2. Hero Section:
   - Create a new bold title and supporting subtitle.
   - Generate a 3-message chat demo showcasing real-world uses.

3. About Section:
   - New description of the assistant’s purpose and vision.
   - Mention Gemini AI under the hood.
   - Highlight core values/features.

4. Features Section:
   - 6 feature cards with new icons, names, and Gemini-powered benefits.

5. Testimonials:
   - 3 fictional users with new names, roles, and reviews.

6. FAQ Section:
   - 8 new FAQs (2 on Gemini, 2 on privacy, 4 on use cases).

7. Legal Pages:
   - Updated Privacy Policy & Terms with fictional company data.

8. Sample Conversations:
   - Showcase Gemini strengths in chats (writing, business, planning).

9. Tech References:
   - Gemini API code samples with latest version.

10. Visual Theme:
   - Cosmic/star/energy abstract graphics.
   - Indigo/blue Tailwind theme vars.
   - Minimalist futuristic icons.

✅ Final Notes:
- Always generate a new assistant name (never reuse NovaAI).
- Keep structure and layout intact.
- Gemini AI must be clearly referenced as the backend engine.
